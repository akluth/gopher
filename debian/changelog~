gopher (3.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * gopher: Removed processing of . at end of text files.  It would stop
    downloading when it would see ".\n" in a file.  Will need to modify
    gopher/ourutils.c:937 area to deal with this properly -- ignore
    .\n if it's at the end of the file, otherwise preserve it.
    Reported by Ashok Aiyar <aiyar@ebv.mimnet.nwu.edu>
  * Did the modification as described above.
  * Updated README.
  * Global change gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu -> gopher@complete.org
  * Removed ./GPL.  This info is now in the file COPYING.
  * Changes to work with Solaris:
    * configure.in: Now looks for strings.h and string.h
    * object/Regex.h: Now include re_comp.h if available.
      Include regex.h only if re_comp.h is unavailable.
      Define the SYSVREGEX stuff only if HAVE_RE_COMP_H is not defined
    * object/String.h: Include string.h and strings.h based on configure
      test.
    Reports from Don Fike <fike@cs.utk.edu>
  * Added doc/PLATFORMS and updated debian/docs
  * gopherd.conf's include of gopherdlocal.conf was hardcoded to /etc.
    Now use configure's sysconfdir to generate it.  Moved gopherd.conf
    to gopherd.conf.in, modified Makefile.in to support this, removed
    gopherd.conf from source tree.  Reported by Kevin Griffin
    <vertov@artstar.com>
  * Added lines to gopherd.conf.in for .ogg and .mp2 files.
    Suggestion from Kevin Griffin <vertov@artstar.com>
  * Using $(INSTALL) from subdirectories broke on systems
    where install-sh was used because $(INSTALL) would always
    resolve to ./install-sh.  Replaced all instances of
    $(INSTALL) with @INSTALL@ (autoconf would provide the correct
    path) and removed INSTALL from Makefile.config.  Reported
    by Don Fike <fike@cs.utk.edu> on Solaris 2.6. 
  * Updated our copy of install-sh with the one from
    a current automake.
  * Updated patchlevel.h for release of 3.0.2.

gopher (3.0.1) unstable; urgency=low
