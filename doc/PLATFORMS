These are the platforms on which gopher is known to work.

Gopher should also work on any Unix/Posix platform (Solaris, SunOS, *BSD,
Linux, MacOS X, etc).  Please let us know if you have troubles compiling or
running gopher on your platform by e-mailing gopher@complete.org.

The second column in the list below indicates the latest version of gopher
that someone has reported about.

Thanks!

If you want to use gopher on older platforms (VMS, Ultrix, etc), please
check out the UMN gopher 2.3.1 distribution.  Gopher 3 is not currently
supporting VMS, though we have not removed the VMS support from the tree. 
(VMS hackers: help us out!)
